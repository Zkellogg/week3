            In the 1990s, creativity was at an all-time high when it came to dancing. 
            Musicians were developing their own moves and writing songs about them. 
            Crazes ranged from popular line dances like the Macarena and the Electric Slide to wilder expressions like MC Hammer's Typewriter Move and the 69 Boyz's Tootsee Roll.
